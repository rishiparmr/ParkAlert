# OCR-based Parking Ticket Processing System

## Overview

This project aims to automate the conversion of scanned parking tickets into structured data using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It further utilizes AI algorithms for data scrubbing and stores the processed data in a MySQL database. The entire system is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenAI (GPT-4)
- Pytesseract
- OpenCV
- MySQL
- Docker

## Features

- Convert scanned images of parking tickets to text using Pytesseract.
- Utilize OpenAI's GPT-4 to identify and correct OCR errors.
- Store processed and cleaned data in a MySQL database.
- Containerized setup using Docker for ease of deployment.
- Advanced data scrubbing to improve data accuracy.
